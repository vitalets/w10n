# TypeScript File Structure

Structure TypeScript source files for top-down reading: a reader should understand what the file does before encountering implementation details.

## Files in Scope

- **Apply to:** TypeScript source files (`.ts` and `.tsx`), such as application modules, components, services, and shared utilities.
- **Ignore:** Configuration files (for example, `vite.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, and `eslint.config.ts`), test files (for example, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, and their `.tsx` equivalents), or files written in other languages.

These scope boundaries apply to all rules below.

## Ordering

1. **File purpose** — start the file with a concise block comment describing the module’s overall purpose and boundaries. Do not list its exports or repeat documentation provided on individual exported members.
2. **Imports** — external dependencies first, then internal modules according to the project's import conventions.
3. **Module-level constants and configuration** — values shared across the file.
4. **Types** — types that define or support the file's API.
5. **Exported/public API** — main functions, classes, or values exposed by the module.
6. **Internal orchestration** — private functions that coordinate the module's main behavior.
7. **Lower-level implementation** — supporting functions ordered roughly by call flow, with callers before callees.
8. **Leaf helpers and utilities** — small implementation details with no meaningful orchestration responsibilities.

## Commenting

- Use multi-line block-form JSDoc for file-level and declaration documentation,
  including existing comments on functions, methods, and constants. Reformat or
  rewrite these comments as needed, preserving their meaning and useful details.
- Document all exported functions and module-level constants. Focus on their purpose and role, not on implementation.
- Do not document constructors.
- For types, internal functions and helpers, comment them only when their purpose, behavior, or role in the module is not obvious from the code and naming.
- Do not restate implementation details that are already clear from the code.
- Do not add `@param` or `@returns` tags when TypeScript already expresses them.
- Where useful, include 1–2 short inline examples, especially for reusable helpers.
- Use simple, direct language. Keep important technical details; simplify the wording, not the content.
- Preserve existing comments inside function and method bodies (including
  constructors and callbacks) as written, including their wording, comment syntax,
  and line breaks. Only adjust leading indentation when surrounding code moves.
  Change or remove these comments only when explicitly requested or when a code
  change makes them inaccurate. This preservation rule takes precedence over all
  other commenting guidance, including for declarations nested inside these bodies.

## Return Types

- Omit explicit return type annotations on functions and methods unless TypeScript requires them. Rely on inference from the implementation to keep code simpler to review.

## Example

```ts
/**
 * Provides API to load and save application settings to persistent storage.
 */

import { storage } from './storage';

/**
 * Storage key used for persisted application settings.
 */
const STORAGE_KEY = 'settings';

export type Settings = {
  theme: string;
};

/**
 * Loads persisted settings and applies the provided defaults.
 */
export async function loadSettings(defaults: Settings) {
  const stored = await readStorage();
  return normalizeSettings(stored, defaults);
}

/**
 * Persists application settings.
 */
export async function saveSettings(settings: Settings) {
  await writeStorage(normalizeSettings(settings, settings));
}

/**
 * Reads the raw settings value from the persistence layer.
 */
async function readStorage() {
  return storage.get(STORAGE_KEY);
}

/**
 * Centralizes persistence writes for this module.
 */
async function writeStorage(settings: Settings) {
  await storage.set(STORAGE_KEY, settings);
}

/**
 * Applies defaults and converts persisted data into the public settings shape.
 */
function normalizeSettings(settings: unknown, defaults: Settings) {
  return defaults;
}

/**
 * Normalizes URLs before they are used as stable storage or comparison keys.
 * `https://example.com/` -> `https://example.com`
 */
function normalizeUrl(url: string) {
  return url.replace(/\/$/, '');
}
```
